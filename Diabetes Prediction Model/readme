Project Idea: Building a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements (e.g., age, BMI, blood pressure). using Random Forest.
Analysis: Exploring feature importance, evaluating model performance (e.g., using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve).
